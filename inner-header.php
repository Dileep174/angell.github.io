                The heat and pressure used to produce regular dry dog food force its once-healthy animal proteins to unfold, tangle and knot together. It’s called protein aggregation and it’s a problem. Because just like knots of tangled hair block water from draining. Knots of tangled protein block the digestive enzymes in a dog's tummy from breaking them down so they can be absorbed. Instead, they’re passed as waste along with their goodness.

        <div class="row px-4">
            <div class="col-md-8 pt-3">
                <p class="">We just presumed we’d feed Ziggy raw. Our new curless Cockapoo puppy. 
                    It’s what his breeder recommended. Its reviews were great. And our neighbour 
                    swore it transformed Luna, her working Lab. </p>
                <p>But then we discovered its risks. ‘Over half raw dog foods contaminated with
                    traces of deadly bacteria,’ like salmonella, listeria or e-coli*. </p>
                <p class="pb-5">And we knew raw wasn’t an option for us.</p>
                <p>You see, one of our daughters is immunosuppressed. Even if we could avoid
                    cross-contamination, Ziggy could still infect her with just a lick or a kiss.</p>
                <p>How could we stop that? </p>
                <p class="pb-5">Undeterred, we were determined to find a healthy, affordable but safe 
                    alternative. So everyone could thrive. </p>
                <p>But after hunting high and low and wasting a fortune on premium, 
                    prescription, pre-biotic, novel protein, high protein and hypoallergenic 
                    recipes, we were no further forward. </p>
                <p>His poo’s were like brown Wr Whippy’s. </p>
                <p>Then a chance meeting with the Angell’s, our angels, changed everything. </p>
                <p class="pb-5">Robert and Jill were two veterans of the dog food industry who’d already 
                    revolutionised the pet food industry once. They were the first to use Fish as a main protein source. And they produced the first ever fish skin dental 
                    treats in their kitchen Aga. They won many awards. </p>
                <p>
                    And with their help, we set out to revolutionise the dog food industry again. 
                    To find a new way to do dry dog food. A better way. One that offered the 
                    health benefits of raw, but without the risks, cost or fuss. </p>
